## Code of Conduct
We follow a Contributor Covenant-style Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and considerate when interacting with maintainers and other contributors.

If this repository does not already include a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, please follow our basic rule: treat everyone with respect. If you experience or observe unacceptable behavior, report it by opening an issue or contacting a maintainer privately.

---

## Ways to contribute
- Report bugs and include steps to reproduce, logs, screenshots, and environment details (OS, browser, version).
- Suggest new features with a clear rationale and example workflow.
- Improve or add documentation and examples.
- Fix bugs or implement features — submit a pull request.
- Improve tests and CI coverage.
- Suggest UX improvements or accessibility fixes.

---

## Getting started (quick setup)
These steps are intentionally generic — replace commands and tool names with ones used by this repo.

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:
   - git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
   - cd <repo>
3. Add upstream remote (optional):
   - git remote add upstream https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
4. Install dependencies:
   - For Node: npm install or yarn
   - For Python: python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
   - For other stacks, follow the README or project-specific dev docs.
5. Create a development environment:
   - Copy example env file if present: cp .env.example .env
   - Populate required environment variables (database URL, API keys, etc.)
6. Run the app locally and ensure it works:
   - npm run dev / make run / flask run / whatever the project uses.
7. Run tests:
   - npm test / pytest / make test

If any step above does not match this repository, update or add a short developer setup section in the README to make onboarding easier.

## Branching & workflow
We use a simple feature-branch workflow:

- Keep `main` (or `master`) branch clean and production-ready.
- Create feature branches from `main`:
  - git checkout -b feat/short-description
  - git checkout -b fix/short-description
- Rebase or merge upstream `main` regularly to keep your branch up-to-date:
  - git fetch upstream
  - git rebase upstream/main
- Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against `main`.

Branch name examples:
- feat/user-invite
- fix/date-time-parsing
- chore/deps-update

---

## Commit messages
We recommend following Conventional Commits (or a similar structured format) to keep history readable and make release automation easier.

Format:
- type(scope?): short-summary
- Blank line
- More detailed description (optional)
- Footer with references (e.g., closes #123)

Example:
- feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation
- fix(api): correct pagination parameters for /tasks endpoint

Common types:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation only changes
- style: formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- refactor: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: adding or correcting tests
- chore: build process or auxiliary tools

---

## Pull request process
Before opening a PR, please:

- Ensure tests pass locally and CI is green.
- Rebase your branch on the latest main (or merge main into your branch if preferred by maintainers).
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Provide a clear description of what you changed, why, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
- Reference related issues using `#<issue-number>`.

Pull request checklist (maintainers may close a PR that doesn't meet these):

- [ ] Branch created from latest `main`
- [ ] Tests added or existing tests updated
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable
- [ ] No sensitive data committed
- [ ] PR description includes motivation and summary of changes

A maintainer will review, request changes if needed, and merge once approved. Expect reviewers to ask for clarifications or small code adjustments.

---

## Testing & CI
- Add unit and integration tests for bug fixes and new features.
- Keep tests deterministic — avoid relying on external systems without mocks.
- If this repo uses a CI provider (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI, etc.), make sure your changes pass the configured pipelines.

If you add long-running tests, consider marking them as integration/slow and document how to run them locally.

---

## Coding standards & style
- Follow existing style in the repository.
- Use the project's linter/formatter (Prettier, ESLint, Black, flake8, gofmt, etc.) before committing.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code. Add comments for non-obvious logic.
- Favor readability and maintainability over clever one-liners.

If this repository does not include linters or formatters, consider opening an issue proposing one — maintainers may welcome a PR adding the configuration.

---

## Documentation
- Update README, architecture docs, or inline code docs when behavior or APIs change.
- Document public APIs and data models clearly.
- For UI changes, include screenshots or animated GIFs showing the change.

---

## Reporting security issues
Do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Contact the maintainers privately:
- Email: replace-with-maintainer-email@example.com
- Or use the project's security policy if present (SECURITY.md)

If you are a maintainer, consider adding a SECURITY.md with preferred contact and disclosure process.

---

## Maintainers & communication
Maintainers will try to respond to issues and PRs in a timely manner, but note that response times may vary.

Preferred communication channels:
- Issues and pull requests on GitHub for public discussion.
- For faster synchronous communication, provide recommended channels (Slack, Discord, etc.) here if applicable.

If you want to be added as a contributor or maintainer, open an issue describing your contributions and availability.

---

## License & CLA
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under this repository's license (see LICENSE file). If this project requires a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), contributors should sign it before a PR can be merged.

---

## Templates & automation
This repository may include:
- Issue templates (bug_report.md, feature_request.md)
- Pull request template (PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- GitHub Actions or other CI configs

If you want help adding these templates, send a PR and we can iterate on it.

## Thank you!
Contributions make this project better — thanks for helping! If you’re unsure where to start, check the `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue` labels in the issue tracker, or open an issue proposing something small and we’ll help you get started.
